# Computing2-Final_Project

This program reads inputted .txt resume files and parses them for specific information (such as name, previous work experiences, time they spent on those experiences, etc.) given by the user of the program to streamline the qualification process for potential employees applying for a job.
Although it isn't perfect, no resume is ever the same as another, so it is difficult to specifically pinpoint exactly where everything will be, so we have the program looking for about where everything "should" be in a resume.

This project was completed in a collaboration with Matthew O'Hara ("mwoh31") for Computing 2.
